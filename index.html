            <div class="main-article">A young man by the name of Parker Posey appears
              to have gone on the hunt for a shiny Pikachu while playing the hit game Pokemon Go.
               This type of incident is not unprecented, but has not been seen for many months
               now since the game's release. Parker appears to be one of the only remaining
               players, and it may just cost him his life. Now planted firmly near the summit of
               Mt. Everest, Parker awaits his rescue meanwhile streaming all of his happenings on
               TikTok. Although his life is clearly in danger, he does not show
               any interest in stopping. He is indeed going viral as we speak and as such
               he is gaining many fans and an income flowing from the TikTok creator fund.
               Well lets hope he makes enough to cover a strong medical bill because I think he will
               certainly need one after this adventure. His friends have reached out asking the rescue
               to not help him until after he has caught the shiny Pikachu. They are indeed
               worried for his safety, but they admit the clout that would come from such a catch. I
               myself am unsure as to the validity of what is going on, but I sort of want to try out the game
               for myself after seeing how invested this kid is. </div>
