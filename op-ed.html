              <div class="op-ed-text">Katana Zero is perhaps one of the greatest indie
                games to ever have been made. The simplistic nature of the design
                allows the player the ability to get lost in the beautiful artwork
                and deceptively deep story. The fast paced cycle of gameplay
                also allows for more complex and diffivult levels designs without
                sacrificing replayability. One can imagine a larger scale game
                created with many of these choiced in mind. I long await the sequel
                to such a beautiful game...</div>

                for my compplex mind, it felt like I was being treated like a child. Also,
                the fast pace and constant crippling dificulty made it no fun to play at all
                but rather felt like a death farm. One of the worst experiences with playing videogames

                falling apart before our very eyes. Covid has lasted much longer
                than the two weeks we were told long ago, and we now are approaching
                a year of isolation. This is brought on by many poor choices of select
                individuals who are not helping. Political strife is also at an alltime
                high with conflict every which way. However, there is one thing that can
                unite all gamers, and that is games of course. Aided by a digital age,
                we are not hurt, but helped by isolation where we can truly unite...</div>

                bless this earth with their presence. They have brought us the wii, providing
                years of entertainment for all ages. There was also the DS which
                never left the hands of so many young people and fueled their love
                for games from a very young age. Most recently we got the Switch, knocking
                expectations out of the water with a brand new Smash Bros game to enjoy. Once you
                login online though, the real pain starts. The Nintendo servers are the weak link

                Series X taking the world by storm, and making parents' wallets weep.
                A gaming console can be one of the most expensive investments for anyone
                to make, but for many it is worth the cost. For others, they are forced
                to watch others as they enjoy their new toy. This can create a hostile
                and damaging environment for the youth, and that is why I propose that people
                should all be given a free PS5...</div>
